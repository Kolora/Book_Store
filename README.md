# Book Store Application

Welcome to the Book Store Application! This is a React-based web application where users can view books, search for books, add books to the cart, and view the final price of the cart items.

# Features

Browse Books: Users can explore a vast collection of books . Each book is displayed with its title, author, brief description and price.

Search Functionality: The application provides a search bar where users can enter keywords to find books matching their search query. The search is optimized to provide relevant results quickly.

Shopping Cart: Users can add books to their cart as they browse through the collection. The cart displays the selected items, along with their individual prices.

Price Calculation: As users modify the contents of their cart, the application dynamically calculates the total price

# Technologies Used

React: The frontend of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

CSS or CSS-in-JS: Styling is done using CSS and CSS-in-JS libraries like Styled Components (Material UI)to ensure a consistent and visually appealing user interface.

Axios: Axios is used for making API requests to retrieve book information and handle user interactions like adding items to the cart and processing payments.
